# Matplotlib Challenge

## Project Background
### **Background**
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

### Data source:
All used data in this project is provided by UNC Chapel Hill’s Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp.

### Files:
- The data folder contains two files, from which the data was imported for this challenge project:
    - Mouse_metadata.csv - contains data on mouse id, drug regimen, the sex of the mouse, the age of the mouse (in months), and the weight of the mouse (g)
    - Study_results.csv - contains data on the mouse id, time point at which tumor measurements were taken, the tumor volume (in mm3), and the number of metastatic sites in the mouse.
- pymaceuticals-code.ipynb - contains all the code used to analyze data, answer project questions, and make visualizations. It also contains a short written analysis at the beginning of the file.
